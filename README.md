# Bus-Booking-System
 A software created using the programming language Python and the DBMS(Database Management System) MySQL, to provide a platform for booking bus tickets and much more.
 The folder contains the main .py file named as Bus_Booking_System_Final_Source_Code_.py
 which has all the python code written for the program to run.
 Then there are 3 MySQL tables project_admin.sql, project_schedule.sql and project_tickets.sql
 which stores and updates the data based on the input and the program.
 As a backup database the software also makes use of the binary files to store data, in the
 schedules.dat and the ticket1.dat
 A pdf file is also attached which has all the details about the code and how it works.
